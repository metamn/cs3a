    <h3>Design</h3>
    
    <p>
      Native web designers work directly in the browser skipping Photoshop, Sketch or other mockup tools reducing project time by half. Csongor is one of them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since 2009 he designed brand identity, e-commerce websites, landing pages for businesses, artist portfolios, blogs and magazines for international companies and organizations.

    <h3>Development</h3>
    
    <p>
      Front-end development with standards and latest technologies&mdash;HTML5, CSS3, jQuery&mdash;is where Csongor is most skilled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On back-end he is using extensively Wordpress and Jekyll&mdash;and&mdash;MVC frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Yii.

    <h3>User Experience</h3>
    
    <p>
      Every website is a product delivering a message for a target audience.
      Products are successful by better-than-expected experiences driving people to engagement.
